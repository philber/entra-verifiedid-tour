# About Microsoft Entra Verified ID

[Microsoft Entra Verified ID](https://aka.ms/verifyonce), part of the 
[Microsoft Entra family of products](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra), is a managed service for verifiable credentials. It provides organizations with a scalable, standards-based way to issue and verify digital credentials with end users or other organizations as part of an identity verification process, such as onboarding, secure access to apps, or account recovery. With Verified ID, organizations can easily and more securely verify workplace credentials, education status, certifications, or other unique identity attributes in seconds. Plus, it respects the privacy of end users, who can own and control their own identity.

Each of us indeed needs a digital identity we own, one which securely and privately stores all elements of our digital identity. Verified ID makes portable, self-owned identity possible, and represents our commitment to an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based decentralized identity future for individuals and organizations. The technology is based on open-source technologies developed in partnership with a wide community of developers, partners, and identity leaders. It allows individuals, organizations, and devices to decide what they share, when they share it, with whom they share it, and - when necessary - take it back.  

Microsoft Entra Verified ID makes it easy to issue and verify such credentials for anyone, anywhere. Our focus is to make it easy for any company to use it every day, and to make it a great experience for the developer community to deliver innovative solutions for endless numbers of use cases.
